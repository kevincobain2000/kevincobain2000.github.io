## Introduction

Astro released in 2022, June, solves one of the major bottlenecks of Nextjs. One of the bottlenecks of Nextjs is not to ship Javascript to the client.

There can be different comparisons made between Astro and Nextjs. In this article, I am going to share a simple comparison of a static portfolio site and its load time on Astro and Nextjs.

Please note that Nextjs has lots of features out of the box, such as ISR (Incremental site regeneration), Nextjs image optimizations, SWR (Stale while revalidate), middlewares, server-side components, and more for which Astro needs to catch up with Nextjs in order to dominate.

I spent a few hours on Astro and my first impressions are positive. It is easy to use and not as confusing as Nextjs. Nextjs’s getStaticProps, getServerSideProps, and JSX can be overwhelming to a beginner to Nextjs.

Astro also allows to use of any library such as Vue, React, and Svelte to be imported into the project. And one of the major wins for Astro is that it doesn’t duplicate the data into JSON for the hydration of pages that Nextjs does, which essentially makes the size of HTML double.

I migrated my portfolio which is a static site from Nextjs to Astro https://kevincobain2000.github.io/.

Further this blog is written in Astro.

## Page load comparison - Nextjs vs Astro

With Astro, there is absolutely zero javascript shipped to the client. The following comparison is based on the load time of the portfolio site, which is a static site generated by Nextjs and Astro.

| Framework | Total Load Time | Total Load Time (3G) |
| :-------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Next js   | 453 ms          | 14.37 seconds        |
| Astro     | 351 ms          | 10.00 seconds        |
