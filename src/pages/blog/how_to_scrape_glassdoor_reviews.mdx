# How to scrape Glassdoor reviews

## Introduction

Glassdoor is a website where employees can anonymously review their employers. It is a great source of information for job seekers and recruiters. It is also a great source of data for data scientists. In this article, we will learn how to scrape Glassdoor reviews using open sourced command line tool.

This is written in Go, and has blazing fast performance. It doesn't use any external libraries, and uses only standard library.

This tool doesn't require login to Glassdoor. It doesn't require API key or anything. Since it scrapes the page, it can be used to scrape any reviews page.

There is a rate limit by Glassdoor. This tool will automatically wait for 1 second after every 1 page crawled.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 20.04 or Mac or any Linux based distribution
- Install [Go](install_go_1_19.mdx)

## Install Glassdoor Scraper

```sh
go install github.com/kevincobain2000/go-glasssdoor-scraper@latest
```

## Scrape Glassdoor reviews

Go to [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) and search for a company. For example, we will search for [Google](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Google-EI_IE9079.11,17.htm). In this case, it is `https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Google-EI_IE9079.11,17.htm`.

Click the Reviews Tab, and you will see the URL is `https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Google-Reviews-E9079.htm`. This is the URL we will use to scrape Glassdoor reviews.

Please note that, due to pagination, you will need to scrape multiple pages.
In this case, we will scrape all pages. For that we have copied the reviews URL of first page.


```sh
go-glasssdoor-scraper -reviews-url="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Google-Reviews-E9079.htm"
```

This will scrape all pages and output json.

## Example output

```json

╰─$ go-glasssdoor-scraper -reviews-url="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Mercari-Tokyo-Reviews-EI_IE1011401.0,7_IL.8,13_IM1071_IP7.htm?filter.iso3Language=eng"

    "Pros": [
        "Well, I had a reasonably good time for two years, but it was quite chaotic and stressful. The Glassdoor reviews are true, many have left the company in a bad way. But a few people have also left it without any issues so it shouldn't stop u from taking the interview. They take probation period very seriously so if u don't perform as per expectations they will discontinue the contract. This is something I have seen many times.",
        "Open and casual work and diverse work environment. I think the company culture is quite different to what is expected of a Japanese company\nMembers are given the opportunity to think for themselves and take on new challenges based on the go bold value",
        "Strong culture and work ethic",
        "The company is trying its best to be a \"non-Japanese\" Japanese company. They work to accomplish this with investment in translation, sponsoring team building events of all shapes and sizes like ski trips or club parties, and having a team of global members there to try and help you do your work and communicate with colleagues. The work is intense, and challenging and with the recent switch to microservices its transistioning from startup to full fledged company",
        "I was an intern at the Android JP team at the Tokyo HQ.\n\nGood work culture- My team was great and I liked the flat hierarchy being implemented well.\nGood compensation- I received a handsome compensation for the internship along with my accommodation being taken care of.\nGreat celebrations- I was lucky to be at the right place at the right time (IPO closing in June), got to attend a lot of good parties.",
        "- Open-minded leadership who encourage employees pushing sound ideas to experimentations\n- Flexible working time and good life-work balance\n- Management support for career growth with path you can easily follow or even shift\n- Opportunities to learn different language with management support"
    ],
    "Cons": [
        "Incompetent management - No career development - Lots of micromanagement situations - Quick and dirty approach to software development - You spend most of your time fixing problems created by management - Most of the talented engineers have already left the company or are about to leave - No company values, ethics regarding patient data management is none existing - People is told in the interviews that they will work on things that don't even exist",
        "Given that company is still 6 years old, there is a lot that still needs to be established",
        "Growth is very high speed and organization is expanding quickly\nYou need to understand strategy and direction",
        "There can only be so much communication to be done by global when the Slack and internal messaging is still very much Japanese. And while the work is rewarding, its also sometimes too hard to find a work/life balance. For example, no one respects 'flex time' and constantly schedule meetings beyond core hours. There is a lack of leadership and being able to bring ideas without a long and thorough record of documents and meetings upon meetings to get \"group buy in\".",
        "Language barrier- If you don't know conversational Japanese, communication can become a bottleneck with co-employees. The translators and interpreters at the Global Operations Team do a great job with live translation during meetings though.",
        "- Processes sometimes differ between groups. However, leadership are working towards common flow that doesn't get in the way of each teams' productivity."
